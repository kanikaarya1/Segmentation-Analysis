6.Ploting the Cluster Boundry and Clusters.

## Conclusions:
"After conducting a K-means clustering analysis on the dataset, we identified five distinct clusters of customers based on their income and spending score. The cluster graph revealed clear segmentation patterns, with each cluster exhibiting unique characteristics in terms of their income level and spending behavior. 
1. Cluster 1 represents customers with low income and low spending score, indicating a potential opportunity for targeted promotions or incentives to increase spending.
2. Cluster 2 comprises customers with moderate income and moderate spending score, suggesting a segment of average spenders.
3.  Clusters 3 and 4 consist of customers with higher income levels, but Cluster 3 exhibits lower spending scores compared to Cluster 4, indicating differing purchasing preferences or behaviors among affluent customers.
